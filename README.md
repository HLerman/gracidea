**Gracidea** is a cartographic project which aims to gather all known *Pokémon* regions into a single 2D map, keeping fidelity to games while taking the liberty of filling blanks and making minor arrangements based on official artworks, anime and manga.

### ![](/client/static/copyrighted/imgs/icons/pokedoll.png) Features

**Gracidea** is not an ordinary world map! See below a short list of the awesome features embedded in it :

* **Faithful maps** : Maps are based first on core games and then filled with region knowledge and interpretations
* **Wild areas** : *Pokémon* can spawn in wild areas! If you're lucky you may see rare encounters and even shinies!
* **Liveful cities** : Humans and trainers populate the *Pokémon* world!
* **World map** : A mini-map lets you access cities and special locations quickly
* *New features will be implemented at a later date !*

### ![](/client/static/copyrighted/imgs/icons/map.png) Maps

Since there are often map redesigns in *Pokémon* franchise, the following games were chosen to represent each region:
* **Kanto** : *Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen*
* **Hoenn** : *Pokémon Emerald*
* *Others regions will follow at a later date !*

Note that some versions include 3D graphics, so these are interpretations of what they could have been if they were in 2D.

#### Current progress

## ![](/client/static/copyrighted/imgs/icons/note.png) Note from the cartographer

I wanted to do something like a *Google maps* but for *Pokémon* games, and this is what gave birth to this project.
I hope you'll be able to enjoy and (re)discover this marvellous franchise with this extensive map !
